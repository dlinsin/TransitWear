TransitWear
===========

Transit for Android Wear was created for a hackathon at the [Google Developer Group DÃ¼sseldorf](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107373371386267684213).

It is meant as an add-on to [Transit Android](http://furryfishapps.com/transit2), which will be released in the coming months, to displays notifications of train or bus departure times on your Android wearable in your vicinity.


### Setup

In order to run the sample, you'll need access to the Preview Wear SDK. 

### Note

This is just a sample code and meant for educational purposes only. It doesn't fetch live departure times nor does it use your real location, in order to make debugging easier.
